#  Rigid body floater with Hydrodynamics: Surge, Pitch, Heave
#  
#  Structure is 100m, with constant diameter (10) and thickness (0.05)
#  A point mass is added at the bottom of the Spar to make it stable and inheave equilibrium
#  Ref point is at 25m
#
#  Applications:
#      Pinned uniform rigid body floater with hydrodynamics 
#            JO theta_ddot + M *g *l/2 sin\theta =   tau_Hydro
